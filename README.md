# Flow-guided Video Inpainting With Scene Template

This is the demo code for 'Flow-guided Video Inpainting With Scene Template (ICCV 2021)'. We propose a flow-based solution to video inpainting by introducing the scene template, a 2D representation of the scene based on a layered formulation. This reduces geometric distortions in flow-based inpainting, creating consistent and crisp inpaintings results.
